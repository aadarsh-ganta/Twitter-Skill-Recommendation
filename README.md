# Twitter-Skill-Recommendation-System

This project creates a skill recommendation model for aspiring data scientists by leveraging Twitter data. With the ever-evolving job market for data science, identifying relevant and in-demand skills is essential for success. Traditional methods, like manually reviewing job boards, can be tedious and unreliable due to filler skills often listed in job postings. Instead, this project explores Twitter as a source of concise, straight-to-the-point insights from employers, CEOs, and industry professionals. By analyzing tweets with hashtags like #DataScience and #Skills, we extract actionable information about the most relevant skills for data science careers. It showcases how social media can provide valuable insights into industry expectations and highlights the importance of adaptability in navigating the rapidly changing landscape of data science careers.

Key Features:

• Used text processing techniques (stop word removal, tokenization, stemming) to filter and analyze tweets

• Cataloged frequently mentioned skills by extracting curated skills and a large-scale dataset of tweets

• Tracked the frequency of skill mentions over time to reveal emerging trends and changes in the data science skillset

• Provided tailored skill recommendations to help aspiring data scientists focus their learning efforts on high-demand skills
